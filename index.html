        ## What is Ido?
        [Ido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ido_%28language%29) is an [artificial language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) that was created to be a universal second language for speakers of diverse backgrounds. It was meant to be as easy to learn as possible, and be [grammatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar), [orthographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography), and [lexicographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicography) consistent and regular.

        It was created in 1907 based off of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) (another language which had identical goals) because of a desire to reform flaws that Esperanto had when it was created 20 years earlier.
        
        ## Why should you learn Ido (instead of Esperanto)?
        First of all, just imagine a world where everyone can communicate. _more needed here_
