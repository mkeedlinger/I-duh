        ## FAQ
        #### How is 'Ido' pronounced?
        Ido is pronounced `/ˈiːdoʊ/` using the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English) (International Phonetic Alphabet) for English.

        For those of you who didn't previously know about the IPA or how to read it, `'` signifies that the primary stress follows it, `i:` is a long 'e' sound as in 'seed', `d` is a 'd' sound as in 'dye', and `oʊ` is a long 'o' sound as in 'bode'. The `/` simply signifies the beginning and end of the use of IPA.

        Simply, Ido is pronounced eedo.

        ## This site
        This site was created by [Michael Edlinger](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MichaelEdlinger88) and [Jesse Smick](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JesseSmick) out of a need for better Ido resources and a more central Ido community. We had seen that there were a few sites out there that had some Ido resources, but they were all incredibly old and seemingly abandoned. We also liked [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and we severly dissapointed that there was no course for Ido! We thought that there should certainly be a resource for Ido the was as awesome as duolingo. We hope that this site can become the hub of Ido, both for learners and for fluent speakers.

        ## Contributing
        _note: We're in the process of learning Ido, but are currently only fluent in English, so you'll have to communicate with us in English. Later this will change though!_

        While we prefer most contributions to be made through our issue trackers, you can reach us through any of our **contact methods**(need to figure out how i want to do this).

        We have two **issue trackers**, one [HERE](https://bitbucket.org/mkeedlinger/ido/issues/new) for general use, or, if you're more technically inclined and have a Github account, you can use the one [HERE](https://github.com/mkeedlinger/ido/issues)

        ### Design, site language and grammar
        If you ever find something that's spelled wrong, or want to contribute something you wrote that you feel works well on the site, or have something you designed that looks better than what we made (not too hard considering our design skills), please let us know!

        ### Ido grammar and translations
        To contribute here, you're really gonna need to know what you're talking about. We don't want to be spreading misinformation! To add words and translations, resolve issues with any of our translations or definitions, or edit anything having to do with Ido grammar you need to do one of two things:

        - Create an issue at either of our issue trackers with extensive citations to sources showing that your proposed change is indeed correct.
        - Contact us directly and establish your position of authority in the Ido community, then tell us what issue there is or your proposed change.
