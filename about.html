        ## This site
        This site was created by [Michael Edlinger](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MichaelEdlinger88) and [Jesse Smick](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JesseSmick) out of a need for better Ido resources and a more central Ido community. We had seen that there were a few sites out there that had some Ido resources, but they were all incredibly old and seemingly abandoned. We also liked [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and we severly dissapointed that there was no course for Ido! We thought that there should certainly be a resource for Ido the was as awesome as duolingo. We hope that this site can become the hub of Ido, both for learners and for fluent speakers.
