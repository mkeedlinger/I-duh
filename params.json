(NOTE: Ido is a spoken language, not a computer language)\r\n\r\n## What is [Ido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ido_%28language%29)?\r\nIdo is an [artificial language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) that was created to be a universal second language for speakers of diverse backgrounds. It was meant to be as easy to learn as possible, and be [grammatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar), [ orthographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography), and [lexicographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicography) consistent and regular.\r\n\r\nIt was created in 1907 based off of [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) (another language which had identical goals) because of a desire to reform flaws that Esperanto had when it was created 20 years earlier.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n### How is 'Ido' pronounced?\r\nIdo is pronounced `/ˈiːdoʊ/` using the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English) (International Phonetic Alphabet) for English.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who didn't previously know about the IPA or how to read it, `'` signifies that the primary stress follows it, `i:` is a long 'e' sound as in 'seed', `d` is a 'd' sound as in 'dye', and `oʊ` is a long 'o' sound as in 'bode'. The `/` simply signifies the beginning and end of the use of IPA.\r\n\r\nSimply, Ido is pronounced eedo.\r\n\r\n### What alphabet does Ido use?\r\nIt uses an English alphabet without any [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic), so you can use it without altering your keyboard or installing any software.\r\n\r\nThe pronunciation of each letter is a little different though, and [much much more consistent that English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti).\r\n\r\n[Here's](http://idolinguo.org.uk/bgrammar.htm) a little more on the pronunciation of the Ido alphabet.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\nThere's not a ton, but here they are:\r\n\r\n- [http://idolinguo.org.uk/](http://idolinguo.org.uk/) seems like a site just about Ido in general with some learning resources of its own\r\n- [https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Easy_Ido](https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Easy_Ido) is an easy and short intro to learning Ido\r\n- [http://www.seiswaves.com/ido/ido_for_all.pdf](http://www.seiswaves.com/ido/ido_for_all.pdf) a more complete tool for learning Ido","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
